# CSC 510 Project - React.js vs Backbone.js [s_idukut]

### Goal
The goal is to compare the two libraries, React.js and Backbone.js, based on various metrics and determine appropriate usability and applicability of each.

### Repo contents
This repository contains two apps in the todomvc folder, scripts in the scripts folder and results for performance tests, community support, jmeter, plato, sonarqube.


### Tools/technologies used
 
 React, Backbone, JS, Python2.x, Python 3.x, Selenium, Chrome dev Tools, JMeter, plato, SonarQube

### todo apps
1. React app
  - Navigate to the react folder and then open terminal and type 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000' (using Python 2)
2. Backbone app
  - Navigate to the backbone folder and then open terminal and type  'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8001' (using Python 2)
  
### Information regarding scripts
1. git_script.py
  - Please use Python 3.x.
  - The access token for the API usage has been hidden from public. (In order to run the script you will have to generate your own access token on GitHub and then place the same in config.py file in the correct location)
  - Install necessary packages as requried in the script.
  - Enter the public GitHub URL of the repository to be explored for obtaining metrics after running the script as "python3 git_script.py" on the terminal.
2. selenium_script_react_chrome.py
  - Please use Python 3.x for running the script
  - Install necessary packages as requried in the script.
  - Download chromedriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it desired location which then need to be used in the script.
  - Migrate to the location of the react app and then simply start a server on 8000 by simply using "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" (please note that for this server use Python 2.x).
  - Simply run the script as "python3 selenium_script_react_chrome.py"
3. selenium_script_backbone_chrome.py
  - Please use Python 3.x for running the script
  - Install necessary packages as requried in the script.
  - Download chromedriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it desired location which then need to be used in the script.
  - Migrate to the location of the backbone app and then simply start a server on 8001 by simply typing "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8001" (please note that for this server use Python 2.x).
  - Simply run the script as "python3 selenium_script_backbone_chrome.py"
